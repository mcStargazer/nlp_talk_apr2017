Python code is for walk-through of machine learning concepts of classification and natural language processing at the April
2017 Oklahoma City Python Users Group meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Oklahoma-City-Python-Users-Group/). Original data and
code from www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/ and is intended for online course at www.udemy.com/machinelearning/.
I enjoyed this entire course and encourage you to take it for MUCH more information on practial machine learning in general.
The code has been heavily modified and amplified before appearing here.
